# Social Network Analytics project
Social media influencers are of enormous importance in digital marketing, as they help organizations in reaching larger audience through Influencer Marketing. The program for this project was coded and executed in Jupyter Notebook.

The overview of the project is as follows,

 Importing the training and testing datasets

 Inspecting the datasets for missing values

 Splitting the training dataset (i.e. 70% for training the model and 30% for testing the model)

 Applying Logistic Regression

 Checking the accuracy of the model by 'accuracy_score' and 'f1_score'

 Applying Random Forest Classification mmodel for improved accuracy

 Deploying the model on the testing dataset for predicting the missing values

 Storing the predicted values in a Dataframe and saving it in a 'csv' format
